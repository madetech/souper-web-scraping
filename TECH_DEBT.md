# Tech Debt

1. Make DB calls Asynchronous - High Effort - Hight Benefit
2. Clean unused Imports - Low Effort - Low Benefit
3. Update README files - Medium Effort - High Benefit

# TODO

<!-- 1. Complete tests -->
<!-- 2. Update functionality in average_by_result -->
<!-- 3. Tidy up code -->
<!-- 4. Get graph working - Highest Priority -->
5. Review other requirements
6. More complex graph (specific sections)
7. Graphs on separate pages
8. Table containing exact same data as graphs (more calls to DB, slower)
9. Filter buttons sort only working on first page (Bug Fix)
 

# Requirements

* As a user, I would like to be able to see how many services have failed each service standard and the main reasons why?

* As a user, I would like to see the trends over the last few years with regards to which services fail assessment and which standards are the primary reason for failure, to understand where improvements are being made? For example, with regards to accessibility, are the digital products improving their delivery to ensure their service meets accessibility standards?

* As a user, I would like to be able to see which services have failed service standard 14 and the main reasons why?
