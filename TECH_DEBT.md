# Tech Debt

1. Make DB calls Asynchronous - High Effort - Hight Benefit
2. Clean unused Imports - Low Effort - Low Benefit
3. Update README files - Medium Effort - High Benefit

# TODO

<!-- 1. Complete tests -->
<!-- 2. Update functionality in average_by_result -->
<!-- 3. Tidy up code -->
<!-- 4. Get graph working - Highest Priority -->
5. Review other requirements
6. More complex graph (specific sections)
7. Graphs on separate pages
8. Table containing exact same data as graphs (more calls to DB, slower)
9. Filter buttons sort only working on first page (Bug Fix)
