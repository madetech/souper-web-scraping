# Tech Debt

1. Make DB calls Asynchronous - High Effort - High Benefit
2. Clean unused Imports - Low Effort - Low Benefit
3. Update README files - Medium Effort - High Benefit

# TODO

<!-- 1. Complete tests -->
<!-- 2. Update functionality in average_by_result -->
<!-- 3. Tidy up code -->
<!-- 4. Get graph working - Highest Priority -->
5. Review other requirements
6. More complex graph (specific sections)
7. Graphs on separate pages
8. Filter buttons sort only working on first page (Bug Fix)    -- pagination error, spoke to Jaseera and it doesn't seem like an possible fix.
9. Remove Average chart from dashboard (keep code written for it just in case )
10. we have the sentiment analysis, just need to resize the modal so we can include it 
11. update calls in server.js to be Async

 

# Requirements

* As a user, I would like to be able to see how many services have failed each service standard and the main reasons why?



* As a user, I would like to see the trends over the last few years with regards to which services fail assessment and which standards are the primary reason for failure, to understand where improvements are being made? For example, with regards to accessibility, are the digital products improving their delivery to ensure their service meets accessibility standards?

* As a user, I would like to be able to see which services have failed service standard 14 and the main reasons why?



* Database testing (create local version for testing purposes)


1. modal pop up research 
2. see if we can set up a test data base
3. clean up / refactor
4. look into decimal point issue, asc and desc report bug
5. look into word cloud?
